Here's a table of common commit types and their corresponding emojis:

| Commit Type | Description | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FEAT | A new feature | ✨ |
| FIX | A bug fix | 🐛 |
| DOCS | Changes to documentation | 📚 |

| PERF | Performance improvements | 🚀 |
| TEST | Adding or modifying tests | 🧪 |
| CHORE | Maintenance tasks (build process, package management, etc.) | 🧹 |

When you commit your changes, please start your commit message with one of the commit types listed above (in all caps), followed by a colon and a brief description of the changes you made. For example:
